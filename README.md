# SOAuth - Silex OAuth Provider

## todos

### Phase 1 v0.0.1
* Access Provider - refresh flow not done
* Refactor ... a lot of things are prefixed with 'Access' ... remove it
* Access Controller needs to expect+verify client secret

### Phase 2 v0.1
* Auth Controller needs to be refactored to handle multiple authentication flows (make it extendable?)
* Invalidate end point ... ?

### Phase 3 v1.0
* Implement outstanding official flows

### Phase 4 v1.0.x
* Implement auth flow that handles/proxies authentication via social platforms ... is that even possible?!
